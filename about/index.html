                        <p>
                            Hello my name is Halisson Bruno, and I am a Software Engineer living in Goiania, Goiás,
                            Brasil.
                            I have been coding since 2009 in several projects that allowed me to improve my skills, both
                            in Back End development and Front End development.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am truly passionate about software development, and it's a pleasure to deliver high
                            quality software, well tested, with beautiful design, with outstanding value for the client
                            in a fair amount of time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Most of my development time has been spent in backend where I could learn a bunch of
                            technologies. I started working professionally on Java Platform, Java and Groovy,
                            in 2010. Since 2012 I am using Ruby on personal and professional projects, where I dedicate
                            most of my improvement. And since 2014 I am working in some small projects with NodeJS.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I had the chance to work on various different architectures, like monolithic apps,
                            micro-services and Service APIs. Projects like e-commerces, financial management systems,
                            process automation, data transformation, data crawling, and many more.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For all the technologies I have experience with automation test tools (Junit, Spock,
                            Cucumber, Rspec, Minitest, Jasmine, MochaJS), build tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle, Grunt, Rake),
                            and their main frameworks (Grails, Rails, Sinatra, Padrino, SailsJS, ExpressJS).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I had the chance to work a lot on Front end also, with lots of different designs. I am
                            mainly concerned about user experience, working to provide a beautiful responsive design,
                            compatible with main devices and browsers, and always with semantic markup.
                        </p>
