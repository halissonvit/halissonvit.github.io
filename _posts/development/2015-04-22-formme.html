<p>
    FormMe allows the creation and management of forms and to store data, in a simple way, for a static site. You just
    need to setup your account, create a new form and point the forms action to the formMe generated url.

<p>
    The objective of the product is mainly for learning and training, and not to replace any of the good
    solutions out there (<a href="https://formkeep.com/">formKeep</a>, <a href="http://pooleapp.com/">pooleApp</a>).
    In fact, I am using PooleApp, and it is more than enough for my needs (a contact form on my jekyll site), and this
    will have an impact on how the development will be driven. But I like the idea of develop this app, because it can
    start very simple, but it will have enough implementation to apply a lot of what I want to study and to work with.
</p>
<p>
    I have 3 main features in mind:
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4 class="typl8-zeta">Create an app to integrate with pooleApp and have a better visualization of the data</h4>

        <p>PooleApp provides an api to create and fetch de data, using two different api keys. So for this I will need a
            way to setup my PooleApp visualization key. Also I want a better visualization then just the json.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4 class="typl8-zeta">Allow the creation of forms independently of third party services</h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4 class="typl8-zeta">Migrate the front-end of the app to use AngularJS, or other similar technology</h4>
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
