    FormMe allows the creation and management of forms, in a simple way. You just need to setup your account, create a
    new form and point the action for it.

<p>
    The objective of the product is mainly for learning and showcase purposes, and not to replace any of the good
    solutions out there (https://formkeep.com/, http://pooleapp.com/). In fact, I am using PooleApp, and it is more than
    enough
    for my needs (a contact form on my jekyll site), and this will have an impact on how I will deal with the
    development of the formMe.
</p>
<p>
    I have 3 main features:
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4 class="typl8-zeta">Create an app to integrate with pooleApp and have a better visualization of the data</h4>

        <p>PooleApp provides an api to create and fetch de data, using two different api keys. So for this I will need a
            way to setup my PooleApp visualization key. Also I want a better visualization then just the json.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Allow the creation of forms independently of third party services</li>
    <li>Migrate the front-end of the app to use AngularJS, or other similar technology</li>
</ol>
